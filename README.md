# Python Capstone DataCamp Mini-Projects (SCH-MGMT 657)
This repository contains 3 applied mini-projects completed as part of a 23-hour individual capstone experience for SCH-MGMT 657: Data Science for Business at UMass Amherst. The capstone is curated from the *Data Scientist with Python* certification track on DataCamp, focusing on core Python skills such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data importing, and machine learning.

Each project demonstrates real-world problem solving using Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, seaborn, and scikit-learn. Code is presented in annotated Jupyter notebooks.
